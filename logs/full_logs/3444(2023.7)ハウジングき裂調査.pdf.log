## Analysis of Crack Growth in Housing

This document contains detailed information and analysis of cracks discovered in two housings.

**Summary:**

- Cracks were identified in both housings, indicating fatigue damage caused by repeated stress.
- The cracks progressed from the surface into the interior, indicating progressive damage.
- The fractured area displayed discoloration, suggesting a fatigue-related fracture mechanism.


**Detailed Findings:**

**Housing A:**

- Cracks originated at the junction of two walls.
- Crack growth direction: horizontal.
- EDS analysis revealed elevated oxygen concentration in the fractured area, suggesting exposure to air during fracture.


**Housing B:**

- Crack initiation point not identified.
- Crack growth direction: vertical.
- SEM analysis showed fractured surface features consistent with fatigue damage.


**Metallographic Analysis:**

- Both housings exhibited a pearlitic ductile iron microstructure.
- Spheroidal graphite nodules were dispersed throughout the matrix of pearlite.
- Analysis confirmed the presence of free ferrite, suggesting susceptibility to intergranular fracture.


**Quantitative Analysis:**

- Ballistic impact analysis confirmed the presence of fatigue cracks in both housings.
- The percentage of pearlite in the microstructure was quantified for both housings.


**Conclusion:**

- Fatigue damage caused the cracks in both housings.
- The difference in crack growth direction suggests varying stress concentrations in each housing.
- Further analysis is recommended to determine the root cause of the fatigue damage.

**Recommendations:**

- Detailed stress analysis of the housings is recommended to identify potential weak points.
- Repair or reinforcement measures should be implemented to prevent further crack growth.
- Periodic inspections of the housings should be conducted to monitor crack progression and ensure timely repairs.
