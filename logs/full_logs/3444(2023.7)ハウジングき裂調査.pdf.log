## Report Summary

**Objective:**
- The report investigates a gear housing (QS5G-80) that exhibited cracks during durability testing.
- The study aims to determine the crack initiation point, growth mechanism, and the influence of fatigue on the crack progression.

**Methodology:**
- Detailed examination of the fracture surface using macroscopy and SEM.
- Elemental analysis of the fracture surface using EDS.
- Metallographic analysis of the fracture area vicinity.

**Results:**
- Fatigue cracks were identified on both tested samples.
- Crack initiation sites were identified at different locations on both samples.
- Fatigue striations were observed on fractured surfaces, suggesting fatigue-induced crack growth.
- EDS analysis confirmed the presence of oxygen on the fracture surface, indicating oxidation during crack growth.
- Metallographic analysis revealed microstructure variations in the vicinity of the fracture, with increased ferrite content and pearlite morphology in the fractured area.

**Conclusion:**
- Fatigue damage caused the cracking of the gear housing.
- The crack growth rate was estimated to be approximately 18,000 cycles.

**Additional Findings:**
- The fracture surface of Sample A-1 showed evidence of partial delamination.
- The fracture surface of Sample B-1 exhibited a larger area of oxidation compared to Sample A-1.

**Recommendations:**
- Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause of crack initiation.
- Fatigue mitigation measures should be considered for future designs.
